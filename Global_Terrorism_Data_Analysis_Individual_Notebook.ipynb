        "####**1. Introduction**\n",
        "#### **What is Terrorism**\n",
        "#### Terrorism is defined in the Oxford Dictionary as **“the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.”**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Terrorism can also be defined as the method of using voilence in various ways to create fear and create a chaotic enviornment within population in order to achieve their various aims like occupying land, changing relegious activities or against any relgion, overthrowing goverment with method of violence or any of their ideological objectives.\n",
        "#### Terrorist act can involve bombings, shootings, hostage taking or any other way of creating violence aginst civilians. The motivations behind terrorism can vary widely, ranging from separatism and nationalism to religious extremism and ideological zeal. Governments, organizations, and international bodies work to counter and prevent terrorism through various means, including intelligence gathering, law enforcement, diplomacy, and addressing root causes such as socio-economic disparities and political grievances.\n",
        "#### **2. Methodology**\n",
        "EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)\n",
        "Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach that is used to analyze the data and discover trends, patterns, or check assumptions in data with the help of statistical summaries and graphical representations.It is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.\n",
        "Few steps of EDA are:\n",
        "Understand the Dataset: Start by gaining a high-level understanding of the dataset. Look at the dataset's structure, the number of rows and columns, and the data types of each column. This step helps you get familiar with the data you'll be working with.\n",
        "Handling Missing Data and Removing Duplicates: Identify missing values in the dataset and decide how to handle them. Depending on the amount and nature of missing data, you can choose to drop rows or columns with missing values, impute missing values with suitable methods, or keep missing values as a separate category if applicable. Check for duplicate records in the dataset. If duplicates exist, decide whether to remove them or handle them based on the specific analysis requirements.\n",
        "Examine Descriptive Statistics: Calculate descriptive statistics for numerical variables such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. This step provides a summary of the central tendency and spread of the data.\n",
        "Visualize the Data: Use various plots and charts to visualize the data and identify patterns, trends, or outliers. Some commonly used visualizations include histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, box plots, and correlation matrices.\n",
        "#### **3. Analysis and Implementation**\n",
        "Exploratory data implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Collect and Load Data: Collecting the dataset from kaggle website i.e. Global Terrorism Database.\n",
        "Loading the dataset using python library Pandas in Jupyter notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Understand the Data: Getting a basic understanding of the GTD data by inspecting the first few rows (data.head()), checking data types (data.info()), and getting summary statistics (data.describe()).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Handle Missing Values: Identify and handle missing data. Used df.isna().sum() to count missing values in each column.\n",
        "Created a function to create a table of missing values with percentage of missing values in it.\n",
        "Depending on the amount of missing data, I choosed to drop columns with more than 40 percent of missing data , and for other analysis I choosed to drop rows and fill missing values, or keep them as a separate category.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Explore Data Distribution: Visualized the distribution of numeric features using histograms (data.hist()). For categorical features, use bar plots (data['feature'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')) to see the distribution.\n",
        "For time series data plotted line plot to see the distribution over a time period i.e. plt.plot()\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Analyze Correlations: Calculate and visualize correlations between numeric features using a correlation matrix (data.corr()). This helped in identifying relationships between variables which seen to be very high.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Visualize Relationships: Visualization done using Python libraries like Plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud.\n",
        "Explored relationships between features using bar plots (plt.bar()), created pie plots(plt.pie) for finding caategorical distribution for each class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Feature Engineering: Added new column casualties to the table by merging two columns killed and wounded.\n",
        "Created date column with right day,month and year in it.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Categorical Insights: Created various categorical bar plot and pie plot.\n",
        "Visualized the data and found insights from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Finalize Insights: Summarize the key insights in points. Identify patterns, trends, potential correlations, and wrote notable findings below them.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **4.Findings**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. As Year passing by these 4 terrorist groups becoming stronger and resulting to major events around the globe\n",
        "A.ISIL ( Islamic State of Iraq and the levant )\n",
        "\n",
        "*   ISIL ( Islamic State of Iraq and the levant ): ISIL was the deadliest group in 2016 with a more than 100 percent increase in deaths from its previous peak in 2015.\n",
        " This group is active in Iraq however after attacks in 2016 it has lower its activites and on further finding s we find out, ISIL is now near complete military defeat in Iraq and Syria.\n",
        " Thus we can see less events from this group for a year two as it was near complete defeat.\n",
        " ISIL main method of attack is Explosion and Bombing.\n",
        " Their most attacked target are 'Private citizen and Property , Military'.\n",
        "*   Taliban: As plotted above the activities of Taliban over years ,their terrorist attack trend keep growing and if it this keeps on they will lead to some major events in coming years as we can see in present day, Taliban overthrowned the Afghanistan goverment and now it is in power in the country.\n",
        " Taliban consistently used bombings and armed assaults as its main modes of attack.\n",
        " Seems their favourite target is 'Police  and   Military'.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Iraq experienced a 40 per cent increase in deaths in 2016 in reflecting the increased intensity of ISIL activity following attacks by the Iraqi Armed Forces.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Middle East & North Africa , South East Asia are the two regions that seen a major surge of terrorism activities from 2005 till 2015 , while Central and South America were least affected."

        "**Define Clear Objectives:** First and foremost, the client should define specific and measurable business objectives related to terrorism data analysis. These objectives should be aligned with the client's overall business goals. For example, objectives could include improving security measures, minimizing operational risks, or optimizing resource allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Collection and Integration:** Collect and integrate relevant global terrorism data from reliable sources. Ensure that the data is comprehensive, up-to-date, and covers the relevant time period. Data sources may include databases like the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) or government reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Data preprocessing is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of the data. This may involve creating visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and heatmaps, to identify patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hypothesis Testing:** Formulate hypotheses or research questions based on the business objectives and conduct statistical tests and analyses to validate these hypotheses. For example, test whether certain factors are associated with higher or lower terrorism rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Predictive Modeling:** If relevant to the business objectives, develop predictive models using machine learning or statistical techniques. These models can forecast future terrorism trends, helping the client take proactive measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Geospatial Analysis:** Utilize geospatial analysis to identify geographical hotspots of terrorism activity. Geospatial tools can help the client pinpoint high-risk areas and allocate resources accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Correlation Analysis:** Conduct correlation analyses, including correlation heatmaps, to explore relationships between various terrorism-related factors, such as attack methods, target types, regions, and time periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reporting and Visualization:** Present the findings and insights in a clear and accessible manner. Use data visualizations, reports, and dashboards to communicate the results effectively to stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Actionable Recommendations:** Based on the analysis, provide actionable recommendations to the client. These recommendations should be tailored to the business objectives and should guide decision-making and strategy development. For example, recommend specific security measures, resource allocation adjustments, or policy changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Monitoring and Evaluation:** Continuously monitor the terrorism landscape and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented strategies and recommendations. Adjust the approach as needed to achieve and maintain the desired business objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Collaboration:** Encourage collaboration between different departments or stakeholders within the client's organization, such as security teams, risk management, and leadership, to ensure a coordinated approach to addressing terrorism-related challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### By following these steps and tailoring the analysis to the client's specific business objectives, the client can leverage global terrorism data analysis to make informed decisions, enhance security, and mitigate risks effectively."
